# Hydrological-Analysis-Using-python
In this project I used Python and different modules like Physeds for automating The hydrological Analysis  Process from Reading the DEM that I extracted from Earth explorer and saved it as a tiff file on my pc.
Then I have filled pits , Depressions and flats in DEM.
after that I specified flow direction values According to the different directions.
N    NE    E    SE    S    SW    W    NW
Then,Accumalation of flow from the flow direction.
I obtained the stream order that exceeds a specific flow accumilation
in my note book I used it to be 1500
I extracted pour points manually from the Interactive plot that I have created.
In Progress
Creating mouse event to extract a list of pour points by creating a mouse event 
which means when pressing on a pour point in the interactive Dashboard
It is added to alist contains all pour points. then we can delinate the watersheds for this list
